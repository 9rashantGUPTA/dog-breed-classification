### Pytorch implementation of Dog Breed Classifier using Transfer Learning

The task is to perform comparison of different CNN models for "Fine-grained Classification" task on 133 class Dog breeds dataset. The models used are as follows:

- Custom 6-layer CNN model
- VGG-16 (trained from scratch)
- VGG-16 (pre-trained)
- ResNet101 (pre-trained)

Data can be downloaded from [a link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).
Weights for the trained model can be found on the project space on [a GoogleDrive](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md).
